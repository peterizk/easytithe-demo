<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>From a psychology point of view:  </b>Self-worth is what
we are born with... as we take in others' comments, etc...that develops
self-esteem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Taking this further from a Christian perspective: </b>We
all have tremendous self-worth as God values each and every one of us no matter
what flaws we have, what skill He has blessed us with (or not blessed us with)
or what has happened in our life.  Despite the fact that we are very valuable
in God’s eyes, our self-esteem may not reflect this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We want to establish that we each have self-worth and
explore how to translate this into building our self-esteem.  I’d like to
address the question: “If God values me, why did He make me clumsy, awkward,
unattractive (to the superficial world), or with whatever other flaws He
created me with.”  Of course the answer is that these things do not matter in
the eternal scope, but how do we deal with it here and now?<br>
<br>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='page-break-after:avoid'><b><span style='font-size:
14.0pt;line-height:115%'>Lesson 1 – What am I Worth?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Conclusion should be that our worth has nothing to do with
what others around us think of us.  God values us and has a strong desire for
us to stay close to Him.  How we respond is key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Attention Getter: </b>Take a $20 bill and ask who would
like to have it. Then crumple it and see if anyone still wants it. Then drop it
in the dirt and stomp on it and ask again. The bill has not lost its value and
is just as precious. Take it to the bank and they’ll accept its full value and
give you a nice crisp bill in its place – just like confession.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Reading: </b>1 Cor. 6:12-20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The question, “Lord, what doYouwant me to do?”, is a
questionwhich the Gospel can answer when we break it down and start asking
questions such as: “Why am I here in this world in the first place?” “What am
Igood for?” When students and young folks ask such questions they are not just
asking,“What am I qualified to do?” They are really asking, “What am I good
for? What do Icount for in this world? How can I make my life worth something?
How can I doworthwhile work?” This is a question of extremely different caliber
than the question of what career I would like to head for. This is the kind of
question that the Gospel beginsto speak to.</p>

off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. After
he&nbsp;had spent everything,&nbsp;there was a&nbsp;severe famine in that whole
country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired&nbsp;himself out to a

longed&nbsp;to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no
one gave him anything.&quot;When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of
my father's hired men have food to&nbsp;spare, and here I am starving to death!
I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned

filled with compassion&nbsp;for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around
him and kissed him.</span></i></p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>She had low self esteem because
     she had a lot of misfortune in her marriage. She had 5 husbands: either
     they died or they divorced her as women could not initiate a divorce. We
     don’t know the reason why she had been married so many times, but we do
     know that she has resorted to an improper relationship outside of
     marriage.&nbsp; We can tell she didn't like to face people because she
     went to the well in the middle of the day (4:4) when no one else would be
     there.&nbsp; Hot weather meant most everyone would go either early in the
     morning or in the evening.  It seems none of the village people respected her.

<p class=MsoNormal style='page-break-after:avoid'><b><span style='font-size:
14.0pt;line-height:115%'>Lesson 4 – In God We Trust</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Start off with a brainstorm on what does the word “trust”
mean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then ask who in their life they trust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then brainstorm list of qualities in a person you trust
(i.e. Why do you trust these people?)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If God is not mentioned, suggest it and see reaction</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Highlight that God is our Creator and&nbsp;is Almighty, and
always knows what is best for us...so we can<br>
trust&nbsp;Him.&nbsp; He always looks out for us (protects us, guides us,
covers us, etc.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No human can be trusted like God can be trusted... in all
conditions, any conditions, and whatever conditions<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span class=text>“Trust in the </span><span class=small-caps><span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>Lord</span></span><span class=text> with all
your heart, </span>a<span class=text>nd lean not on your own understanding” </span>Prov3:5
- trust in the Lord,&nbsp;lean not on your own understanding<br>
Ps 118:8<br>
Ps37:3,5<br>
Ps18:30<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Example of David and Goliath - how David trusted in God to help him&nbsp;defeat
Goliath. <br>
Whatever&nbsp;&quot;Goliath&quot; we face, we need to bury one truth deep
within our heart: God loves you and when you place your trust in Him, He will
not allow you to suffer defeat.  Abouna John Paul went over this is great
detail during the winter retreat, so remind them of this.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Continue by linking trust with faith</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Faith<br>
defined in Hebrews 11:1 - substance of things hoped for; evidence of things
unseen<br>
Example of cell phone&nbsp;and how it works despite not &quot;seeing&quot;
phone waves of communication.<br>
Example of many things you don't see or understand (such as the internet or a
car) yet know/believe that they work.  The braking system in today’s cars are
very complex and you do not understand how it all works, yet you have faith
that when the driver presses the brakes, the car will slow down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Christians, we are called to provide the source of our
hope and spread the gospel; this is very important&nbsp;and we need to be
reminded of this calling regularly</p>
